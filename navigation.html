<h1>AI-Assisted Navigation System</h1>
<span class="badge">Ongoing Project</span>

<p>
    The <strong>AI-Assisted Navigation System</strong> focuses on providing accurate
    and reliable navigation in environments where GPS signals are weak, unavailable,
    or unreliable.
</p>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>
    GPS-dependent navigation systems fail in tunnels, indoor environments, and
    dense urban regions, leading to navigation errors and safety concerns.
</p>

<h2>System Overview</h2>
<p>
    The system integrates AI models with sensor data to estimate user location and
    guide navigation continuously, even in signal-denied environments.
</p>

<h2>Workflow</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Sensor data acquisition</li>
    <li>AI-based location estimation</li>
    <li>Path prediction and correction</li>
    <li>Continuous navigation updates</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Navigation without GPS dependency</li>
    <li>AI-driven location estimation</li>
    <li>Improved accuracy through sensor fusion</li>
    <li>Adaptive learning for real-world conditions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Artificial Intelligence algorithms</li>
    <li>Sensor fusion techniques</li>
    <li>Data-driven navigation models</li>
</ul>

<h2>Current Status</h2>
<p>
    🚧 <strong>Ongoing Development</strong> – The project is currently under active
    development with continuous testing and performance improvements.
</p>

<h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Real-time deployment on embedded platforms</li>
    <li>Integration with assistive wearable devices</li>
    <li>Enhanced accuracy using machine learning models</li>
</ul>
