    <p>
        SoundScout is an AI-powered assistive wearable designed for visually and
        hearing-impaired individuals. It detects environmental sounds in real-time
        and provides haptic feedback to improve safety and situational awareness.

    <ul>
        <li>Real-time sound detection using AI</li>
        <li>Haptic feedback for alerts</li>
        <li>Assistive technology for social impact</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
        Individuals with sensory impairments often struggle to detect important
        environmental sounds such as alarms, vehicle horns, and approaching people,
        which can pose safety risks.
    </p>

    <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
    <p>
        SoundScout uses AI-based sound classification to identify critical sounds
        and convert them into vibration patterns, enabling users to respond without
        relying on visual or auditory cues.
    </p>

    <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Machine Learning for sound classification</li>
        <li>Microphone sensors</li>
        <li>Haptic motors</li>
        <li>Embedded processing unit</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Impact</h2>
    <p>
        The project enhances independence, mobility, and safety for individuals
        with disabilities and demonstrates the use of AI for social good.
