<h1>DeepTrace – Drug Detection System(Ongoing)</h1>
<span class="badge">Ongoing Project</span>

<p>
    <strong>DeepTrace</strong> is an intelligent drug detection and analysis system
    designed to identify prohibited or harmful substances using computational
    techniques. The project emphasizes accuracy, speed, and reliability in
    substance identification.
</p>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>
    Conventional drug detection methods rely heavily on laboratory-based testing,
    which is time-consuming, expensive, and unsuitable for rapid screening
    scenarios such as border control or on-field inspections.
</p>

<h2>System Overview</h2>
<p>
    The system processes sample data through multiple stages including preprocessing,
    feature extraction, and classification. Each stage is optimized to reduce noise
    and improve detection accuracy.
</p>

<h2>Workflow</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Input data acquisition and preprocessing</li>
    <li>Feature extraction from chemical signatures</li>
    <li>Pattern matching and classification</li>
    <li>Final detection and reporting</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Automated substance identification</li>
    <li>High accuracy through data-driven analysis</li>
    <li>Reduced dependency on manual inspection</li>
    <li>Modular architecture for scalability</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Data analysis techniques</li>
    <li>Pattern recognition algorithms</li>
    <li>Python-based processing pipeline</li>
</ul>

<h2>Challenges Addressed</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Handling noisy and incomplete data</li>
    <li>Improving classification accuracy</li>
    <li>Reducing false positives</li>
</ul>

<h2>Applications</h2>
<p>
    The system can be applied in forensic analysis, pharmaceutical quality control,
    security screening, and regulatory enforcement environments.
</p>

<h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Integration with real-time sensor inputs</li>
    <li>Expansion to detect a wider range of substances</li>
    <li>AI-based adaptive learning models</li>
</ul>
